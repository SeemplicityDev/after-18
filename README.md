# After-18

![Are you sure?](https://github.com/avi-city/after-18/blob/main/images/are-you-sure.png?raw=true)


## Brief
A Chrome Extension that works only on Github’s “pull request” pages, and changes the text on the “Merge” button after a given hour (18:00 in our case) to remind the developer about the consequences of pressing that button.
